## Library of Things

Build a tool which can store items (be they links, files, etc.) and retrieve them quickly. Implement tagging and sorting to find them faster.

This is a purposefully open-ended assignment, to encourage people to find something in their life which needs sorting, and build a tool that will actually help them with it. This could be a website, a command-line tool, or whatever!

Things that should work:

* Adding items to the library
* Retriving items from the library
* Filtering the items in the library by name
* Tagging items in the library with some form of metadata
* Filtering the items in the library by tag

Ideal Goals:

* Make the storing, retrieval, and search as fast as possible.
  * This is a good time to look into interesting sorting and searching algorithms!
* Add autocompletion in as many ways as possible
  * Tag names, item names, etc etc.
  * For web applications, returning results with a partial search (a la google search)

## Web Framework

Make a server that listens for HTTP requests & calls different functions for different urls.

Things that should work:

* Handle GET requests
* Handle POST requests from forms
* URL mapping

## Twitter Clone

Clone Twitter! Or make an absurd-bizarro micro Twitter that only lets you tweet 14 characters! Or in haikus!

Things that should work:

* User authentication
* Post tweets
* Follow users
* Profile pages with recent tweets, followers, following
* Feed (view tweets from everyone you follow)

## Browser

A browser (basic example: just render text and hyperlinks, ignore all other html tags)

## Static Site Generator

Search through the current directory and convert foo.less to foo.css (using an external compiler obviously)

## Compress/Decompress Utility

A compress/decompress utility (basic example: handle single files only, with huffman coding)

## Database

a database (basic example: store key-value pairs in a single file, provide insert, find, and delete functions)

## Pacman

pacman (basic example: no ghosts or pills, just walk your guy through a maze until the dots are gone)
