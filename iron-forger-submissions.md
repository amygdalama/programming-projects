## Library of Things

Build a tool which can store items (be they links, files, etc.) and retrieve them quickly. Implement tagging and sorting to find them faster.

This is a purposefully open-ended assignment, to encourage people to find something in their life which needs sorting, and build a tool that will actually help them with it. This could be a website, a command-line tool, or whatever!

Things that should work:

* Adding items to the library
* Retriving items from the library
* Filtering the items in the library by name
* Tagging items in the library with some form of metadata
* Filtering the items in the library by tag

Ideal Goals:

* Make the storing, retrieval, and search as fast as possible.
  * This is a good time to look into interesting sorting and searching algorithms!
* Add autocompletion in as many ways as possible
  * Tag names, item names, etc etc.
  * For web applications, returning results with a partial search (a la google search)
