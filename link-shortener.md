## Link Shortener
*Copied from a Hacker School Friday Jobs Prep assignment created by Tom Ballinger and Alan O'Donnell*

Build a website that allows you to submit a link, then gives you a new, hopefully shorter url to use for that link.

* Build a webpage you can visit in a web browser.
* Make a form on this webpage
* Make submitting the form return a new link that can later be used to get back to that site

More things to do:
* Display data on how much that link gets used
* Make that data private to whoever made the original shortened link
* Make shortened links not guessable
* Deploy your site somewhere besides localhost
* Graphically display the click data
* Load test your server - can you take 100 posts per second? 1000 shortened link GETs per second? How many redirections or shortens can your site do per second? What was the bottleneck?
* Make a bookmarklet that gives the user the shortened version of a link without leaving a page.
* Style your page a bit
* Update your link click stats in realtime (no refresh required)
* Break down link click stats by browser
* Build an api for people to use to access their click data
