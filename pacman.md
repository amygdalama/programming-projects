## Pacman Clone

### Basic Instructions
* Make a maze.
* Make a Pacman-like creature that can walk around the maze (but can't go through the walls) that you can control from your keyboard.
* Add pellets for your creature to eat. Make the pellets disappear when the creature walks over them.
* Keep track of and display the score (how many pellets your creature eats)
* Add ghosts! Either make them all start in a box in the middle of the maze, or just randomly put them in the maze. They should walk around the maze.
* Figure out what to do when ghosts run into walls or intersections. You can just have them randomly choose a direction at first. Or maybe they can walk through walls, because, you know, they're ghosts.
* Figure out what to do when the ghosts run into each other. Maybe they should reverse directions. Maybe they should turn into MEGA GHOSTS. Maybe they should just walk through each other, because, you know, they're ghosts.
* If any of the ghosts run into your creature, GAME OVER, sucker

### More ideas
* Add levels! When all the pellets are eaten, trigger the next level rather than end the game. Make the ghosts move faster.
* Keep track of high scores, and announce at the end of the game if the user beat a high score
* Let your creature have multiple lives! If a ghost runs into your creature, it looses a life. Then, when your creature runs out of lives, GAME OVER
* Add fruit! Eating fruit gives you MEGA POINTS or additional lives or something
* Add power pellets! If your creature eats them, then it can eat ghosts, but only temporarily. Add some sort of visual cue that indicates whether your creature can currently eat the ghosts or not.
* Make the amount of time the power pellets have an affect be a function of the current level - the higher the level, the shorter your creature is allowed to eat ghosts
* Make the ghosts smarter! Make them walk in the direction of your Pacman creature.
